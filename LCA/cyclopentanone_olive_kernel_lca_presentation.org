#+TITLE: Life Cycle Assessment of Cyclopentanone production from Olive Kernels
#+AUTHOR: Vidianos Giannitsis, Nikos Stavrou

* Goal
The goal of this study is to assess the environmental impact of Cyclopentanone production from Olive Kernel. Cyclopentanone is a chemical used widely in pharmaeceuticals and its production from renewables and especially so waste, is interesting to compare with the production from petroleum sources.
* Process for comparison
The conventional production process for cyclopentanone is based on the heating of an aquatic solution of adipic acid with Ba(OH)2. The mixture slowly distills to cyclopentanone [1]. Adipic acid however uses benzene as its precursor which is very toxic for both human and environment. For this reason, we would like to replace this process with a different process and see how the two compare.
* Impacts assessed
The carbon footprint of the process will be studied as it is generally considered an important metric. Besides that, the petrelaic process uses benzene, therefore, human toxicity should probably be included to show the adverse impact of that material, while the olive kernel process uses a lot of water, therefore water usage is a metric that is quite important to show the adverse impact of that process. Lastly, the energy demand of the two processes is very important to assess.

If the approach was cradle-to-gate (starting from the cultivation of the olives), the assessment of eutrophication and land use would be more important. Now however, these will be rather low in our process.

* Scope II
** Functional Unit
The functional unit that was selected is 1 kg of cyclopentanone. Since we are comparing 2 production methods of the same material, it was assumed that a more intricate functional unit was not necessary.

* Life Cycle Inventory
LCI Table
* Assumptions
To model this process in CCalc, some assumptions were necessary, which are listed below:

- For cooling needs, tap water is used and no additional energy requirements are listed.
- For furfural production, catalytic amount of sulfuric acid is used, which isn't included in the LCI
- The waste streams containing organic compounds (furfural, cyclopentanone, hexane) are assessed cumulatively as Chemical Oxygen Demand, which in CCalc is reflected only in the eutrophication impact.
- The vapor strema of the Flash is considered pure enough in hydrogen to be a co-product and not a waste material
- The electricity requirements of the pumps is negligible, while other electricity needs of the factory were not assessed due to difficulty in finding them.
- Olive kernel was modelled as residual wood chopping.
- Heat was modelled as Heat at cogen 1400 kWh, wood as in the original aspen, heat was produced from lignin.
* Allocations
Besides the final product of cyclopentanone, some other streams were considered co-product streams and should somehow be included in the impact assessment. These streams are: The solid stream of steam explosion, which contains cellulose and lignin, the hydrogen rich stream of the flash and the furfural rich stream of the distillation process.

For the first stream, it is hard to assess the economic value of the three components of the kernel (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) to do economic allocation and energy allocation isn't very useful, therefore, the allocation methodology followed is mass allocation. The other two streams are very low in quantity and therefore impacts should be allocated to them with mass allocation.

* Conventional Process LCI
For modelling cyclopentanone production in CCalc, Ba(OH)2 was not found in the ecoinvent database, so its production from the mineral barite was modelled based on a patent describing the process [2].

* Uncertainty in input variables
However, these results have a high amount of uncertainty becauses ome of the things in the LCI were based on assumptions. Furthermore, this analysis allows us to see what impact each improvement would yield. Specifically, from the input variables, we assume uncertainty in these variables: 

- The olive kernel is highly uncertain because data for the steam explosion was taken from literature from 20 years ago. In these years, yields could have significantly improved. Furthermore, an assumption was made that all the hemicellulosic stream is xylose which isn't exactly correct.
- The water used for steam explosion is based on a process on a much smaller scale and a linear scale-up was assumed. In reality, the analogy of olive kernel to water might be different.
- The amount of hexane selected for extraction was arbitrarily calculated in Aspen Plus and gives good results, but is not necessarily optimal.
- Similarly, the distillation columns are potentially not optimally designed and seeing how changes in them will affect the LCIA is interesting.
- Lastly, the hydrogen needed for cyclopentanone has uncertainty. We assume it is less as the data was taken from a more recent article and the amount used is slightly above stoichiometric, but we can still include it as uncertainty. Another reason for uncertainty is that we modelled hydrogen as gray hydrogen, but green hydrogen could also be used potentially.

* Input Range studied
  By controlling these 6 design variables (which are not only where we have uncertainty, but also where we have degrees of freedom for improvement) we can see how the process changes. To find the sensitivity of the process in each of these variables, we selected 5 values for each of the variables and ran the LCIA varying each one independently. Some of them, like the olive kernel, also directly causes changes to other parameters, such as the water used for steam explosion (assuming the same analogy), the emissions of the steam explosion process and the solids produced.

| Olive Kernel | Water | Hexane | Heating | Cooling | Hydrogen |
|--------------+-------+--------+---------+---------+----------|
|            6 |     3 |   0.02 |     1.5 |     0.5 |     0.04 |
|            8 |     4 |   0.03 |       2 |       1 |     0.06 |
|           10 |     5 |   0.04 |     2.5 |     1.5 |     0.07 |
|           14 |     7 |   0.08 |     3.5 |     2.5 |     0.09 |
|           16 |     8 |    0.1 |       5 |       4 |      0.1 |

  We noticed that the input variables we are controlling are linearly related with the output variables (impacts). Since the relation is linear, performing sensitivity analysis of the process is very easy as the sensitivity to each parameter is simply its coefficient in the linear relation. This relation can also give us the minimum and maximum we can expect in each impact.

* Improving Water Usage
The biggest problem of the process is water usage. Improving the water usage isn't so easy, as half of the water needs are for cooling inside which is hard to decrease. From the ones we can control, the process is 5 times more sensitive to the cooling of the distillation column than the steam needed for the steam explosion. However, this is not very significant. The best way to decrease water usage is via optimization of water usage with Pinch point analysis or water reuse.

* The role of Olive Kernel in improving the process
The second most important parameter is decreasing the amount of olive kernel necessary for the process as it will help in almost all impacts. It is the hot spot of the carbon footprint and human toxicity and plays a role in energy demand and eutrophication potential of the process. The process is not so sensitive to this change as it is to others, but the extraction of xylose from the kernel is highly inefficient and improving that process has potential to significantly decrease the olive kernel requirements and as such lower these impacts.

* The role of Steam in improving the process
Decreasing the amount of steam needed for the steam explosion is also very impactful. This will be decreased by decreasing the olive kernel, but if we can find that less water than what was initially assumed (half of the kernel's mass) can be used, this will significantly improve the energy demand of the process (as it is sensitive to it and it is the hot spot of the process), it will improve the human toxicity of the process decently and also lower water usage, albeit it not being the most impactful parameter for this.

* The role of Hydrogen in improving the process
Using less hydrogen is the other parameter that can significantly affect the system. It plays a very significant role in the carbon footprint of the process and is the parameter to which the system is the most sensitive to. Decreasing the amount of hydrogen used is rather hard, but replacing the gray hydrogen with something like green hydrogen has the potential of improving the carbon footprint of the process significantly.

* The role of Hexane in improving the process
Hexane is a parameter to which the system is very sensitive, showing that if we wrongly underestimated its value, we have wrongly assessed the process as much more environmentally friendly than it is. However, for improving the process, there is a very narrow range to which hexane can help, as the amount used is already very low and isn't a significant hot spot. It should be mentioned that decreasing it will lower the eutrophication potential by a wide margin, but the process already has a rather low eutrophication potential so this isn't as significant.
